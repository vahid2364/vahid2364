## Hi 👋, I'm Vahid Attari


**vahid2364/vahid2364** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I’m an Assistant Professor passionate about the intersection of AI and materials science. My research focuses on developing intelligent systems to accelerate the design and discovery of advanced materials.

🔬 I specialize in:
- **Bayesian optimization** and **deep learning** for materials informatics
- **High-entropy alloys (HEAs)** and their mechanical and thermodynamic optimization
- **Energy materials** with an emphasis on thermal conductivity, diffusion, and phase stability
- Building frameworks for **multi-objective optimization** in materials design

⚡ I lead projects that aim to:
- Accelerate the discovery of novel materials using AI-driven models
- Develop hybrid platforms that integrate **physics-based modeling**, **machine learning**, and **high-throughput experimentation**
- Create scalable solutions for data management and retrieval in materials research

📊 Currently developing:
- **DataScribe.Cloud**: a smart data management and optimization platform for materials researchers
- Modular tools for **multi-objective Bayesian optimization** in composition–property relationships

🧠 I'm also expanding into areas like:
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for materials knowledge
- Generative models for microstructure-informed design
